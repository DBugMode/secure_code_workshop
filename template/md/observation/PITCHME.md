## Everything that a user does should leave these trails

+++

## The only way you can accomplish this is to bake it into your design

+++

## When you get a request, record it

+++

## When you take an action at the direction of a request, record it

+++

## Record it in a way that it can be indexed and searched

+++

## Where do you get it from?

+++

## Basic reads can come from web server logs

+++

## Everything else requires application level logging

+++

## It's a good idea to keep and analyze web server logs, but better to have the application write audit logs

+++

## You get more control over what is logged

+++

## You have more options for timing, behavior, and format of logs

+++

## You get separation of pure audit vs general application logs
