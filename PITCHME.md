# Introduction

+++

## There's a lot we *could* talk about today

+++

## But this is my "greatest hits" list

+++

## You should learn the OWASP Top 10

+++

## You should learn about preventing vulnerabilities in code

+++

## But that's not as important, and it gets *all the* attention

+++

## Flaws vs Vulnerabilities

+++

## All vulnerabilities are bugs in software

+++

## They have a reasonably fixed cost for remediation

+++

## They can be curbed by better software hygiene

+++

## And they tend to be isolated

+++

## Flaws are bugs in design

+++

## They tend to carry a much higher cost for remediation

+++

## And are typically more devastating in nature

+++

## This course focuses mostly on flaws

+++

## But feel free to ask questions about anything
